# ICT-Modul295 Frontend

## Jetstream Skiservice Web API

This frontend is designed to showcase the full experience with the backend.  
The main frontend is located at [https://github.com/mahgoe/ICT_Modul294_Praxisarbeit](https://github.com/mahgoe/ICT_Modul294_Praxisarbeit).

Since this project is focused mainly on the form, I created it separately to save space.  
Unnecessary elements have been removed.

Features implemented include:

- `index.html` (serves as the main form)
- `admin.html` (allows the admin, or the workers in our project, to log in to this panel)
- `adminconfirm.html` (once the password and JWT-Token are verified, full access to user orders is granted)
- `adminshutdown.html` (automatically shuts down after 3 failed login attempts)
- `admin-reset` (enables the admin to reset their account)

Implemented in this version:

- `index.html`
